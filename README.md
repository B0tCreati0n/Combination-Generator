# Combination Generator

The Combination Generator is a Python script that generates combinations based on a given combination pattern. It allows you to specify different characters to be included in the combinations.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

## Usage
Run the script by executing the following command:

```
python combination_generator.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the combination pattern. Use the following symbols to represent character sets:
- `*` for the digits 0-9
- `#` for lowercase letters (a-z)
- `Â¤` for uppercase letters (A-Z)
- `!` for special characters
- `?` for a combination of numbers, letters, and special characters

Next, provide the location to save the generated combinations. The script will check if the location is valid.

Then, enter the filename. If a file with the same name already exists in the specified location, you will be prompted to confirm whether you want to overwrite it.

If the number of combinations exceeds 1 million, you will be warned about the potential time and space requirements. You can choose to proceed or abort the operation.

The script will generate and save the combinations to the specified file.

## Notes
- The generated combinations will be saved with each combination on a separate line.
- The number of combinations may affect the processing time and file size.
- It is recommended to provide a valid location and filename to avoid conflicts.
